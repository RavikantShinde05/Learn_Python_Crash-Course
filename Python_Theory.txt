Python is a widely used high level language with huge community support 
and large Ecosystem and cross platform compatible and also has various applicaions 
in the field of :
Data Science, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, AI/ML, 
Automations, web Apps, Testing, Hacking, etc.

where as python uses interpreter to understand and 
execute the code line by line.

We will be learning python version 3:

i am using VsCode for python as per my convinience with the plugin or extension of "python" 
it will provide me features like: Autocompletion,
Debugging, Code snippets, and code formatting and Linting.

Python Peps: it stands for python enhancement proposals.
this helps you to format your code automatically.
After installation create a file name "Hellow_World.py"
use Autopep8 for formatting support for python in Vscode extensions

the python comes with an interpreter which is a program which understand 
the python high-level code into machine code as explain below:

from python code => Cpython interpreter => PythonByte code => python virtual machine (PVM) => machine code. 

this Cpython is a program created in "C" which understand python code, it is created/ emplementation of python in "C".
Similarly for Jython, ironPython, and pypy => java+python, c#+Python and Python+subset of Python respectively.

i.e the python program is converted in to java bytecode so that we can run it using java code
so that we can run java code using python when using Jython.
