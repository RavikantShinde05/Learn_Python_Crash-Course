# Nested Loops:

# for Loops:
# print co-ordinates:

for x in range(5):  # Outer Loop:
    for y in range(3):  # Inner Loop:
        print(f"({x}, {y})")

# the interpretre iterates it by every elemenst:
# like iterations goes from "x of 0 + y of 0".
# them "x of 0 + y of 1".

# output will be:
# (0, 0)
# (0, 1)
# (0, 2)
# (1, 0)
# (1, 1)
# (1, 2)
# (2, 0)
# (2, 1)
# (2, 2)
# (3, 0)
# (3, 1)
# (3, 2)
# (4, 0)
# (4, 1)
